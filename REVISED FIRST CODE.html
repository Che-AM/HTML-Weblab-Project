                    <h1>Fun fact</h1>
                    <p>
                        He produced the short film that eventually became a major feature length picture. I wonder what his responsibilities were and the ways in which he contributed to that project. Phenomenal movie.

                    <h2>Another Fun fact</h2>
                    <p>
                        Nicholas Britell produced hip hop in college while studying composition at harvard. This influenced is clearly seen in the trap elements of his Succession score

                Personally, Nicholas Britell’s music, specifically in the film <cite>If Beale Street could talk</cite>, is a large part of the reason that I went to music school in the first place. His poignant setting is quiet thought provoking and masterclass in Brass and string writing. I will work with him one day.
