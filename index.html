                        He produced the short film that eventually became a major feature length picture. I wonder what his responsibilities were and the ways in which he contributed to that project. Phenomenal movie.

                Personally, his music, specifically in the film <cite>If Beale Street could talk</cite>, is a large part of the reason that I went to music school in the first place. His poignant setting is quiet thought provoking and masterclass in Brass and string writing. I will work with him one day.
